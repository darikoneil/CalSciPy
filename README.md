## CalSciPy
This python packages contains a variety of useful methods for handling, processing, and visualizing calcium imaging data. It's intended to be a collection of useful, well-documented functions often used in boilerplate code alongside software packages such as [Caiman](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn), [SIMA](https://github.com/losonczylab/sima), and [Suite2P](https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p).

#### Highlights
* Assign unique colormaps to subsets of ROIs to generate rich, informative videos
* Perona-Malik diffusion for edge-preserving denoising
* GPU-parallelized multidimensional filtering
* Interactive visualization

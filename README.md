This python packages contains a variety of useful methods for handling, processing, and visualizing calcium imaging data. I noticed I was constantly re-writing boilerplate, "one-liners", and copy/pasting code between environments. I wrote this so ~I don't have to~ you don't have to.  It's intended to be a collection of useful, well-documented functions often used in boilerplate code alongside software packages such as [Caiman](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn), [SIMA](https://github.com/losonczylab/sima), and [Suite2P](https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p).

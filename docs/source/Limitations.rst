Limitations
***********
The current implementation is unstable, partially untested, partially finished, and should be considered an open
alpha/beta. Please be patient, this is a pet-project and I have to graduate.

Stable Modules
**************
Until things are more stable, I'll explicitly note which modules' are stable, have >90% test coverage, and are
ready-to-use.

Contributions
*************
Save me from myself

I only want the X, why do I need to install Y?
**********************************************
Sorry, when things are stable I'll break off 3/4/5 into optional subpackages

Installation
############
Eventually I will break the distributions up so you don't have to install everything together.
For right now, everything is in one package.

Full Install
************
Enter ``pip install CalSciPy`` in your terminal.

GPU Install
***********
If you want to use gpu-parallelization, you will need to install `CuPy <https://github.com/cupy/cupy>`_
by following these `instructions <https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html>`_.

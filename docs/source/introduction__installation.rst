Installation
############
Eventually I will break things up into sub-packages so you don't have to install everything together.
For right now, everything is in one package. If you want to use gpu-parallelization, you will need to install CuPy.

Full Install
************
Enter ``pip install CalSciPy`` in your terminal.

CalSciPy
====================================
**CalSciPy** is a utility toolbox for calcium imaging experiments. It contains a variety of useful features, from
interactive visualization of data to computer-generated holography for "read/write" experiments, and
everything in-between. Essentially, it's a collection of code written for my imaging experiments that might be
considered useful to others.

Motivation
**********
While working on my Ph.D. I noticed I was constantly re-writing boilerplate, "one-liners" and copy/pasting
more-extensive code between environments. Ever try to use a minimally-documented function written during exploratory
analysis on a different operating system two years later?  During some lunchtime reflection, I realized that a lot of my
colleagues were simultaneously writing (and re-writing) very similar code to mine. How much time have scientists spent
reinventing the wheel? Why did each of us write our own GUI for interacting looking at traces? And why do they all rely
an unstandardized, idiosyncratic organization of datasets. I decided to spend a little extra time thoroughly
documenting and testing to put together this package so at least my friends and could easily analyze data across
various environments, interpreters and operating systems. While having all your code so well documented and tested
tastes more time--I found it does wonders for your stress levels (documenting is a relaxing monotonous activity) and
people like you more. Plus, all the abstraction and documentation makes your analysis easy to read and follow.
As my programming skills and scientific expertise have grown, I've started to roadmap the inclusion of some more complex
functionality--*refactoring* my existing code of interest, *writing* code for my projects with distribution in mind,
and implementing new features the science community could benefit from --because making scientific software open-source
and proliferating expertise is simply the right thing to do.

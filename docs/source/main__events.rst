Events and Spiking
==================

Firing Rates
````````````
CalSciPy provides several small functions that abstract firing rate calculations and improve the readability of your
scripts.

* :func:`calc_firing_rates <CalSciPy.events.calc_firing_rates>`\: Calculate instantaneous firing rates from
  spike (event) probabilities.
* :func:`calc_mean_firing_rates <CalSciPy.events.calc_mean_firing_rates>`\: Calculate mean firing rates instantaneous firing rates.
* :func:`normalize_firing_rates <CalSciPy.events.normalize_firing_rates>`\: Normalize firing rates by scaling to a max of 1.0.

Limitations
###########
The current implementation is unstable, partially untested, partially finished, and should be considered an open
alpha/beta. Please be patient, this is a pet-project, I have a newborn, and I need to finish my thesis.
Until things are more finalized, I'll explicitly note which modules are stable, have >90% test coverage, and are
ready-to-use. Anything not listed as table should be considered experimental and use at your own risk. If you really
need something labeled experimental I can probably provide offline code that will probably prove more useful short-term.
While the majority of features are already written, they need to be refined for maintainability, readability, and to
remove any bugs.

Stable Modules
**************
The following modules are stable as of the indicated version. Any new features added will be demarcated with a
version added tag in the documentation.

* :module:`traces <CalSciPy.traces>` 0.7.5

* The main module is ready to use as of 0.7.5. New features will be demarcated by a label indicating the version added.
* The bruker module is unstable and not incorporated into the distributed pypi version
* The organization module is unstable and not incorporated into the distributed pypi version
* The interactive module is not incorporated into the repo yet
* The optics module is not incorporated into the repo yet

Limitations
###########
The current implementation is unstable, partially untested, partially finished, and should be considered an open
alpha/beta. Please be patient, this is a pet-project and I have to graduate. Until things are more stable, I'll
explicitly note which modules' are stable, have >90% test coverage, and are ready-to-use.

* The main module is ready to use as of 0.7.5. New features will be demarcated by a label indicating the version added.
